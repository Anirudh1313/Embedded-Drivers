# Embedded-Drivers
FreeRTOS drivers from NXP data sheet.

I have written drivers for SPI, I2C, UART, PWM, ADC, Interrupts. But my professor doesn't want me to push them to my github as they are part of a graduate class assignments. I am one of the TA's for that class all student know me to check on my git.
